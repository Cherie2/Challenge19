# 19 Progressive-Web-App-Text-Editor

## Motivation

The motivation for this project is to build a text editor that runs in the browser and is a progressive web application. I will be implementing code for the client side of this application as the server-side has been provided already.The web application will have persistent data.

In completing this project, I have learned the basic concepts of utilizing web packages.
